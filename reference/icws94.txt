1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose
This standard seeks to fully define and describe the game of Core War.

1.2 Overview
Core War is a game in which programs compete for control of a computer
called MARS (for Memory Array Redcode Simulator).  Redcode is the name
of the assembly language in which Core War programs, called warriors,
are written.

In order to play Core Wars, access to a Core War system is required.
A Core War system at a minimum must have a MARS executive function
(interpreter) and a way to load warriors into core (the MARS memory).
Most systems include a Redcode assembler, either separately or as part
of the loader.  Also, many systems include a graphical interface and
code debugging features.  Some systems have the ability to run
automated tournaments.

1.3 Acknowledgements
This document is the fourth standard for Core War, the first three
being "Core War Guidelines" (March 1984) by D. G. Jones and
A. K. Dewdney, the International Core War Society standard of 1986 -
"Core Wars" (May 1986), principally authored by Graeme McRae and the
"Core Wars Standard of 1988" (Summer 1988), principally authored by
Thomas Gettys.  The latter two standards are often referred to as
ICWS'86 and ICWS'88, respectively.

2. Redcode Assembly File Format

2.1 Purpose
A Redcode assembly file consists of the information necessary for a
Redcode assembler to produce a load file.  A standard assembly file
format allows programmers to exchange warriors in a more meaningful
format than load files.  An assembly file, through the use of labels,
arithmetic expressions, and macros can also greatly reduce the work
necessary to produce a particular warrior while enhancing code
readability.

2.2 Description
Each Redcode warrior consists of one or more lines of Redcode.  Each
line of Redcode consists of a string of alphanumerals and special
characters.  Special characters in Redcode are the addressing mode
indicators for immediate '#', direct '$', indirect '@', predecrement
indirect '<', and postincrement indirect '>' modes, the field
separator (comma) ',', the comment indicator (semicolon) ';', the
arithmetic operators for addition '+', subtraction '-', multiplication
'*', division '/', and  modulus '%', and opening '(' and closing ')'
parentheses for precedence grouping.

A line may be blank or consist of an instruction, a
pseudo-instruction, a comment, or an instruction or
pseudo-instruction followed by a comment.  Each line is terminated
with a newline.  All comments begin with a semicolon.  Each
instruction consists of these elements in the following order: a
label, an opcode, an A-operand, a comma, and a B-operand.  Each
element may be preceded and/or followed by whitespace other than a
newline.  The label is optional.  If either operand is blank, the
comma may be omitted.

Pseudo-instructions appear just like instructions but are directives
to the assembler and do not result in object code as an instruction
would.  Each pseudo-instruction has a pseudo-opcode which appears
where an opcode would appear in an instruction.  The format of the
remainder of the pseudo-instruction depends on which pseudo-opcode is
used.  For the remainder of this section (2.2) and the next (2.3),
references to "opcode" include "pseudo-opcode" assembler directives.

A label is any alphanumeric string other than those reserved for
opcodes.  Labels are case sensitive, i.e. "start" is different from
"Start".  An opcode is any of the following: DAT, MOV, ADD, SUB, MUL,
DIV, MOD, JMP, JMZ, JMN, DJN, CMP, SLT, or SPL.  Opcodes may be in
upper or lower case or any combination.  An opcode may be followed by
a modifier.  A modifier always begins with a dot.  A modifier is any
of the following: .A, .B, .AB, .BA, .F, .X, or .I.  Modifiers may be
in upper or lower case or any combination.

Each operand is blank, contains an address, or contains an addressing
mode indicator and an address.  An address consists of any number of
labels and numbers separated by arithmetic operators and possibly
grouped with parentheses.  All elements of an address may be separated
by whitespace.

2.3 Grammar
Tokens are separated by whitespace (space and tab) exclusive of
newline characters, which are used for line termination.  End-of-file
should occur only where newline could logically occur, otherwise the
load file has been terminated prematurely.

In the following, 'e' is the "empty" element, meaning the token may be
omitted, a caret '^' means NOT, an asterisk '*' immediately adjacent
means zero or more occurrences of the previous token, and a plus '+'
immediately adjacent means one or more occurrences of the previous
token.  The vertical bar '|' means OR.

2.4 Assembly To Load File Conversion
A Redcode program can be assembled into a list of MARS instructions.
(When assembled to a file instead of directly to core, the list is
called a load file.  See Section 3).  Each Redcode instruction
assembles into a MARS instruction of five fields: an opcode.modifier
field, the A-mode field, the A-address field, the B-mode field, and
the B-address field.  A missing (null or blank) mode assembles as '$'
does.

If no modifier is present in the assembly instruction, the appropriate
modifier is appended to the opcode.  The appropriate modifier depends
upon the opcode, the modes, and which standard (ICWS'86 or ICWS'88) to
consider (ICWS'88 by default).  See Appendix A for the appropriate
translations.

The address field values are derived from the numbers, labels, and
arithmetic operators contained in the addresses.  Labels are
converted to an address relative to the current instruction.  Then
the arithmetic operations are carried out according to the
appropriate operator and parenthetical precedence to determine the
final value.  If there is only one operand associated with a DAT
instruction, this operand is assembled into the B-mode and B-address
fields, while #0 is assembled into the A-mode and A-address fields.
For all other instructions with only one operand, this operand is
assembled into the A-mode and A-address fields and #0 is assembled
into the B-mode and B-address fields.

2.5 Pseudo-instructions
Pseudo-opcodes are "ORG", "EQU", and "END".

"ORG" ("ORiGin") is a way for the assembly file to indicate the 
logical origin of the warrior.  The A-operand contains an offset to 
the logical first instruction.  Thus "ORG 0" means execution should 
start with the first instruction (the default) whereas "ORG 6" means 
execution should start with the seventh instruction. Although multiple 
ORG instructions are of no additional benefit to the programmer, they 
are allowed. When there is more than one ORG instruction in a file, 
the last ORG instruction encountered will be the one that takes 
effect.

"EQU" ("EQUate") is a simple text substitution utility.  Instructions
of the form "label EQU text" will replace all occurrences of "label"
with the (probably longer and more complicated) "text" before any
actual assembly takes place on the file.

"END" indicates the logical end of the assembly file.  If END has an
A-operand, then the A-operand indicates the logical origin of the
warrior in the same manner as ORG does. No instruction following END
should be assembled.


2.6 Comment Conventions
";redcode" as a first line identifies the file as a Redcode
assembly file.  The "" is optional and implementation
dependent.

";strategy " indicates a comment for "public" consumption.

";name ", ";author ",
";version ", and ";date "
offer uniform ways of presenting this information.

";kill " is for removing warriors from ongoing
tournaments.  If no  is supplied, all of the author's
previous submissions will be removed.

                                   ; the instruction labelled "start".
        END


3. Load File Format

3.1 Purpose
A load file represents the minimum amount of information necessary for
a warrior to execute properly and is presented in a very simple format
which is a subset of the assembly file format presented in Section 2.
A standard load file format allows programmers to choose assemblers
and MARS programs separately and to verify assembler performance and
MARS performance separately.  Not all Core War systems will necessarily
write load files (for example, those which assemble directly to core),
but all systems should support reading load files.

3.2 Description

Each load file will consist of one or more lines of MARS
instructions or comments.  Each line is terminated with a newline.
All comments start with with a semicolon.  Each MARS instruction
consists of five fields: an opcode.modifier pair, an A-mode, an
A-field, a B-mode, and a B-field.  The A-mode is separated from the
opcode.modifier pair by whitespace and the B-mode is separated from
the A-field by a comma and additional whitespace.  Each MARS
instruction may be followed by extraneous information, which is
ignored.  Note that the instruction format for load files is more
rigid than for assemply files to simplify parsing. No blank modes or
operands are allowed.


3.3 Grammar
Tokens are separated by whitespace (non-marking characters such as
SPACE and TAB) exclusive of newline characters, which are used for
line termination.  End-of-file should occur only where newline could
logically occur, otherwise the load file has been terminated
prematurely.

        load_file:
                list
        list:
                line | line list
        line:
                comment | instruction
        comment:
                ; v* EOL | EOL
        instruction:
                opcode.modifier mode number , mode number comment
        opcode:
                DAT | MOV | ADD | SUB | MUL | DIV | MOD |
                JMP | JMZ | JMN | DJN | CMP | SLT | SPL |
                ORG
        modifier:
                A | B | AB | BA | F | X | I
        mode:
                # | $ | @ | < | >
        number:
                whole_number | signed_integer
        signed_integer:
                +whole_number | -whole_number
        whole_number:
                numeral+
        numeral:
                0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
        v:
                ^EOL
        EOL:
           newline | EOF
        newline:
           LF | CR | LF CR | CR LF


3.4 Comment Conventions
Comment conventions for load files are the same as for assembly files.
Of particular note are the "; name " and "; author
" comments.  These comments provide a more suitable
identification of programs to the MARS than "Warrior #1", "Warrior #2",
etc.  It also allows for less cryptic identification than by filename.

4. Run-time Variables

4.1 Purpose
This section describes those variables which are determined just prior
to running a battle by the person running the battle.  It also
enumerates some of the standardized sets of variables used for
tournaments.

4.2 Variables
Run-time variables consist of the following:

Core Size:
        Core size is the number of instructions which make up core
        during the battle.

Cycles Before Tie:
        In each cycle, one instruction from each warrior is executed.
        This variable determines how many cycles without a winner
        should be executed before declaring a tie.

Initial Instruction:
        The initial instruction is that instruction which is preloaded
        into core prior to loading warriors.  In addition to loading
        an instruction such as "DAT #0, #0" into all of core, the
        initial instruction could be set to "NONE", meaning core should
        not be cleared between battles, or "RANDOM", meaning core
        instructions are filled with randomly generated instructions.

Instruction Limit:
        The maximum number of instructions allowed per load file.

Maximum Number of Tasks:
        Each warrior can spawn multiple additional tasks.  This
        variable sets the maximum number of tasks allowed per warrior.
        In other words, this is the size of each warrior's task queue.

Minimum Separation:
        The minimum number of instructions from the first instruction
        of one warrior to the first instruction of the next warrior.

Read Distance:
        This is the range available for warriors to read information
        from core.  Attempts to read outside the limits of this range
        result in reading within the local readable range.  The range
        is centered on the current instruction.  Thus, a range of
        500 limits reading to offsets of (-249 -> +250) from the
        currently executing instruction.  The read limit can therefore
        be considered a mini-core within core.  An attempt to read
        location PC+251 reads location PC-249 instead.  An attempt to
        read location PC+500 reads location PC instead.

        Read distance must be a factor of core size, otherwise the
        above defined behaviour is not guaranteed.

Separation:
        The number of instructions from the first instruction of one
        warrior to the first instruction of the next warrior.
        Separation can be set to "RANDOM", meaning separations will be
        chosen randomly from those larger than the minimum separation.

Warriors:
        The initial number of warriors to battle simultaneously in
        core.

Write Distance:
        This is the range available for warriors to write information
        to core.  Attempts to write outside the limits of this range
        result in writing within the local writable range.  The range
        is centered on the current instruction.  Thus, a range of 500
        limits writing to offsets of (-249 -> +250) from the
        currently executing instruction.  The write limit can
        therefore be considered a mini-core within core.  An attempt 
        to write location PC+251 writes to location PC-249 instead.  
        An attempt to write to location PC+500 writes to location PC 
        instead.

        Write distance must be a factor of core size, otherwise the
        above defined behaviour is not guaranteed.

5. MARS

5.1 Purpose
The Memory Array Redcode Simulator (MARS) is the computer in which
Core War warriors do combat.

5.2 Description
A minimally-complete MARS consists of a core, a loader, task queues,
the MARS executive function, and a way to present the final results of
a battle.  Additionally, many MARS provide a "real-time" battle
display and various debugging tools.

The core consists of a cyclic list (0, 1, 2, ..., M-2, M-1, 0, 1, ...)
of M MARS instructions.  The integer M is referred to as "core size".
All operations are performed modulo M.  Core initialization (the
initial instructions placed in core before loading warriors) is a
run-time variable (see Section 4).

The loader loads warriors into core, converting all negative field
values N to positive field values P such that 0 <= P < M and P = kM
+ N for some integer k.  Subsequently, all field values G greater
than or equal to M are converted to field values L = G modulo M.
The loader also initializes each warrior's task queue with the
appropriate task pointer.

There is a task queue for each warrior loaded into core.  Each task
queue can hold a limited number of task pointers.  The "task limit"
(number of tasks an individual warrior's task queue can hold) is a
run-time variable.  The task queues are FIFOs (First In, First Out).

Each warrior consists of one task initially.  Subsequent tasks are
added to the warrior's task queue using the SPL instruction.
Attempted execution of a DAT instruction by a task effectively removes
that task from the warrior's task queue.

Warriors execute for a specified number of cycles ("time limit", see
Section 4) or until only one warrior is still executing, whichever
occurs first.  Each cycle, one instruction from each warrior is
executed.  The instruction to execute is the instruction pointed to by
the next task pointer in the warrior's task queue.  A warrior is no
longer executing when its task queue is empty.

The following expressions are used in describing the MARS executive
function's operation.

General Definitions:
   An instruction consists of an opcode, a modifier, an A-operand,
           and a B-operand.
   An A-operand consists of an A-mode and an A-number.
   An A-mode is the addressing mode of an A-operand.
   An A-number is an integer between 0 and M-1, inclusive.
   A B-operand consists of a B-mode and a B-number.
   A B-mode is the addressing mode of a B-operand.
   A B-number is an integer between 0 and M-1, inclusive.

Specific Definitions:
   The program counter (PC) is the pointer to the location in core of
           the instruction fetched from core to execute.
   The current instruction is the instruction in the instruction
           register, as copied (prior to execution) from the PC
           location of core.
   The A-pointer points to the instruction the A-operand of the
           current instruction references in core.
   The A-instruction is a copy of the instruction the A-pointer
           points to in core (as it was during operand evaluation).
   The A-value is the A-number and/or the B-number of the
           A-instruction or the A-instruction itself, whichever are/is
           selected by the opcode modifier.
   The B-pointer points to the instruction the B-operand of the
           current instruction references in core.
   The B-instruction is a copy of the instruction the B-pointer
           points to in core (as it was during operand evaluation).
   The B-value is the A-number and/or the B-number of the
           B-instruction or the B-instruction itself, whichever are/is
           selected by the opcode modifier.
   The B-target is the A-number and/or the B-number of the instruction
           pointed to by the B-pointer or the instruction itself,
           whichever are/is selected by the opcode modifier.

All MARS instructions are executed following the same procedure:
1. The currently executing warrior's current task pointer is
   extracted from the warrior's task queue and assigned to the
   program counter.
2. The corresponding instruction is fetched from core and stored in
   the instruction register as the current instruction.
3. The A-operand of the current instruction is evaluated.
4. The results of A-operand evaluation, the A-pointer and the
   A-instruction, are stored in the appropriate registers.
5. The B-operand of the current instruction is evaluated.
6. The results of B-operand evaluation, the B-pointer and the
   B-instruction, are stored in the appropriate registers.
7. Operations appropriate to the opcode.modifier pair in the
   instruction register are executed.  With the exception of DAT
   instructions, all operations queue an updated task pointer.
   (How the task pointer is updated and when it is queued depend on
   instruction execution).

All pointers are PC-relative, indicating the offset from the source of
the current instruction to the desired location.  All arithmetic is to
be done modulo M, with negative values converted in the same manner as
during loading as discussed above (P = M + N).  Additionally, all
reads of core are done modulo the read limit (R) and all writes of
core are done modulo the write limit (W).  Read offsets O greater than
R/2 from the current instruction are converted to backwards offsets of
O = O - R.  A comparable conversion occurs for write offsets greater
than W/2.


5.3 Address Modes

5.3.1 Immediate
An immediate mode operand merely serves as storage for data.  An
immediate A/B-mode in the current instruction sets the A/B-pointer to
zero.

5.3.2 Direct
A direct mode operand indicates the offset from the program counter.
A direct A/B-mode in the current instruction means the A/B-pointer is
a copy of the offset, the A/B-number of the current instruction.

5.3.3 Indirect
An indirect mode operand indicates the primary offset (relative to the
program counter) to the secondary offset (relative to the location
of the instruction in which the secondary offset is contained).  An
indirect A/B-mode indicates that the A/B-pointer is the sum of the
A/B-number of the current instruction (the primary offset) and the
B-number of the instruction pointed to by the A/B-number of the
current instruction (the secondary offset).

5.3.4 Predecrement Indirect
A predecrement indirect mode operand indicates the primary offset
(relative to the program counter) to the secondary offset (relative to
the location of the instruction in which the secondary offset is
contained) which is decremented prior to use.  A predecrement
indirect A/B-mode indicates that the A/B-pointer is the sum of the
A/B-number of the current instruction (the primary offset) and the
decremented B-number of the instruction pointed to by the A/B-number
of the current instruction (the secondary offset).

5.3.5 Postincrement Indirect

A postincrement indirect mode operand indicates the primary offset
(relative to the program counter) to the secondary offset (relative to
the location of the instruction in which the secondary offset is
contained) which is incremented after the results of the operand
evaluation are stored.  A postincrement indirect A/B-mode indicates that
the A/B-pointer is the sum of the A/B-number of the current instruction
(the primary offset) and the B-number of the instruction pointed to by
the A/B-number of the current instruction (the secondary offset).  The
B-number of the instruction pointed to by the A/B-number of the current
instruction is incremented after the A/B-instruction is stored, but
before the B-operand is evaluated (for post-increment A-mode), or
the operation is executed (for post-increment indirect B-mode).


5.4 Modifiers

5.4.1 A
Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to the A-number of
the A-instruction and the B-value set to the A-number of the
B-instruction.  A write to core replaces the A-number of the
instruction pointed to by the B-pointer.

For example, a CMP.A instruction would compare the A-number of the
A-instruction with the A-number of the B-instruction.  A MOV.A
instruction would replace the A-number of the instruction pointed to
by the B-pointer with the A-number of the A-instruction.

5.4.2 B
Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to the B-number of
the A-instruction and the B-value set to the B-number of the
B-instruction.  A write to core replaces the B-number of the
instruction pointed to by the B-pointer.

For example, a CMP.B instruction would compare the B-number of the
A-instruction with the B-number of the B-instruction.  A MOV.B
instruction would replace the B-number of the instruction pointed to
by the B-pointer with the B-number of the A-instruction.

5.4.3 AB
Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to the A-number of
the A-instruction and the B-value set to the B-number of the
B-instruction.  A write to core replaces the B-number of the
instruction pointed to by the B-pointer.

For example, a CMP.AB instruction would compare the A-number of the
A-instruction with the B-number of the B-instruction.  A MOV.AB
instruction would replace the B-number of the instruction pointed to
by the B-pointer with the A-number of the A-instruction.

5.4.4 BA
Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to the B-number of
the A-instruction and the B-value set to the A-number of the
B-instruction.  A write to core replaces the A-number of the
instruction pointed to by the B-pointer.

For example, a CMP.BA instruction would compare the B-number of the
A-instruction with the A-number of the B-instruction.  A MOV.BA
instruction would replace the A-number of the instruction pointed to
by the B-pointer with the B-number of the A-instruction.

5.4.5 F
Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to both the
A-number and B-number of the A-instruction (in that order) and the
B-value set to both the A-number and B-number of the B-instruction
(also in that order).  A write to core replaces both the A-number and
the B-number of the instruction pointed to by the B-pointer (in that
order).

For example, a CMP.F instruction would compare the A-number of the
A-instruction to the A-number of the B-instruction and the B-number of
the A-instruction to B-number of the B-instruction.  A MOV.F instruction
would replace the A-number of the instruction pointed to by the
B-pointer with the A-number of the A-instruction and would also replace
the B-number of the instruction pointed to by the B-pointer with the
B-number of the A-instruction.

5.4.6 X
Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to both the
A-number and B-number of the A-instruction (in that order) and the
B-value set to both the B-number and A-number of the B-instruction
(in that order).  A write to to core replaces both the B-number and
the A-number of the instruction pointed to by the B-pointer (in that
order).

For example, a CMP.X instruction would compare the A-number of the
A-instruction to the B-number of the B-instruction and the B-number of the
A-instruction to A-number of the B-instruction.  A MOV.X instruction would
replace the B-number of the instruction pointed to by the B-pointer with the
A-number of the A-instruction and would also replace the A-number of the
instruction pointed to by the B-pointer with the B-number of the
A-instruction.

5.4.7 I
Instruction execution proceeds with the A-value set to the
A-instruction and the B-value set to the B-instruction.  A write to
core replaces the entire instruction pointed to by the B-pointer.

For example, a CMP.I instruction would compare the A-instruction to
the B-instruction.  A MOV.I instruction would replace the instruction
pointed to by the B-pointer with the A-instruction.


5.5 Instruction Set

5.5.1 DAT
No additional processing takes place.  This effectively removes the
current task from the current warrior's task queue.

5.5.2 MOV
Move replaces the B-target with the A-value and queues the next
instruction (PC + 1).

5.5.3 ADD
ADD replaces the B-target with the sum of the A-value and the B-value
(A-value + B-value) and queues the next instruction (PC + 1).  ADD.I
functions as ADD.F would.

5.5.4 SUB
SUB replaces the B-target with the difference of the B-value and the
A-value (B-value - A-value) and queues the next instruction (PC + 1).
SUB.I functions as SUB.F would.

5.5.5 MUL
MUL replaces the B-target with the product of the A-value and the
B-value (A-value * B-value) and queues the next instruction (PC + 1).
MUL.I functions as MUL.F would.

5.5.6 DIV
DIV replaces the B-target with the integral result of dividing the
B-value by the A-value (B-value / A-value) and queues the next
instruction (PC + 1).  DIV.I functions as DIV.F would. If the
A-value is zero, the B-value is unchanged and the current task is
removed from the warrior's task queue.

5.5.7 MOD
MOD replaces the B-target with the integral remainder of dividing the
B-value by the A-value (B-value % A-value) and queues the next
instruction (PC + 1).  MOD.I functions as MOD.F would. If the
A-value is zero, the B-value is unchanged and the current task is
removed from the warrior's task queue.

5.5.8 JMP
JMP queues the sum of the program counter and the A-pointer.

5.5.9 JMZ
JMZ tests the B-value to determine if it is zero.  If the B-value is
zero, the sum of the program counter and the A-pointer is queued.
Otherwise, the next instruction is queued (PC + 1).  JMZ.I functions
as JMZ.F would, i.e. it jumps if both the A-number and the B-number
of the B-instruction are zero.

5.5.10 JMN
JMN tests the B-value to determine if it is zero.  If the B-value is
not zero, the sum of the program counter and the A-pointer is queued.
Otherwise, the next instruction is queued (PC + 1).  JMN.I functions
as JMN.F would, i.e. it jumps if both the A-number and the B-number
of the B-instruction are non-zero. This is not the negation of the
condition for JMZ.F.

5.5.11 DJN
DJN decrements the B-value and the B-target, then tests the B-value
to determine if it is zero.  If the decremented B-value is not zero,
the sum of the program counter and the A-pointer is queued.
Otherwise, the next instruction is queued (PC + 1).  DJN.I functions
as DJN.F would, i.e. it decrements both both A/B-numbers of the B-value
and the B-target, and jumps if both A/B-numbers of the B-value are
non-zero.

5.5.12 CMP
CMP compares the A-value to the B-value.  If the result of the
comparison is equal, the instruction after the next instruction
(PC + 2) is queued (skipping the next instruction).  Otherwise, the
the next instruction is queued (PC + 1).

5.5.13 SLT
SLT compares the A-value to the B-value.  If the A-value is less than
the B-value, the instruction after the next instruction (PC + 2) is
queued (skipping the next instruction).  Otherwise, the next
instruction is queued (PC + 1).  SLT.I functions as SLT.F would.

5.5.14 SPL
SPL queues the next instruction (PC + 1) and then queues the sum of
the program counter and A-pointer. If the queue is full, only the
next instruction is queued.

A. Differences Between Standards

A.1 Purpose
This appendix lists some of the major differences between this standard
and those standards which preceded it.  The purpose is to help those
who are familiar with a previous standard or standards to quickly
understand those items which are new or have changed.


A.2 Changes

A.2.1 Assembly Files
A comma is required for operand separation.

Parenthetical expressions are allowed.

There is a new pseudo-opcode, ORG, for specifying the first logical
instruction.

There is a new operator, modulus '%', for determining the remainder
of integer division.

A.2.1.1 ICWS'86 to ICWS'94 Conversion
If a modifier is missing, it is assembled according to conversion
rules that depend on whether the ICWS'86 or '88 standard is emulated.
By default, a MARS should use the ICWS'88 conversion rules. Emulation
of ICWS'86 is optional.

    Opcode                  A-mode  B-mode  modifier
    ------------------------------------------------
    DAT                     #$@<>   #$@<>   F
    MOV,CMP                 #       #$@<>   AB
                            $@<>    #       B
                            $@<>    $@<>    I
    ADD,SUB,MUL,DIV,MOD     #       #$@<>   AB
                            $@<>    #$@<>   B
    SLT                     #       #$@<>   AB
                            $@<>    #$@<>   B
    JMP,JMZ,JMN,DJN,SPL     #$@<>   #$@<>   B
    ------------------------------------------------

A.2.1.2 ICWS'88 to ICWS'94 Conversion
The default modifier for ICWS'88 emulation is determined according
to the table below.

    Opcode                  A-mode  B-mode  modifier
    ------------------------------------------------
    DAT                     #$@<>   #$@<>   F
    MOV,CMP                 #       #$@<>   AB
                            $@<>    #       B
                            $@<>    $@<>    I
    ADD,SUB,MUL,DIV,MOD     #       #$@<>   AB
                            $@<>    #       B
                            $@<>    $@<>    F
    SLT                     #       #$@<>   AB
                            $@<>    #$@<>   B
    JMP,JMZ,JMN,DJN,SPL     #$@<>   #$@<>   B
    ------------------------------------------------

A.2.2 Load Files
A load file format is specified for the first time.  (An object code
did exist for ICWS'86).


A.2.3 MARS
There are no illegal instructions.

MUL, DIV, and MOD have been added.

Opcode modifiers have been added.

Read and Write distance limitations have been imposed.
